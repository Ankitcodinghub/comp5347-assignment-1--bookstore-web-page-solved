Introduction

In this assignment, you will demonstrate that you have the basic understanding of the core client-side technologies (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and are able to create a HTML pages with desirable style and certain interactive features. You will be given a small start file set, which contains a complete CSS file and a skeleton HTML file. Your task is to produce an online bookstore Web page that implements the below requirements without using any third-party CSS frameworks or JavaScript libraries.

Main Requirements

The following functionalities must be implemented in your Web page:

‚Ä¢ The main page should display the main information of each book including a thumbnail picture, title, author, year, price, publisher and category. (See Figure 1 as an example).

‚Ä¢ End users can search books with their titles. The rows that match the search term will be highlighted with a colored background. (see Figure 2 as an example)

‚Ä¢ End users should be able to filter books through their categories. The list of category works like a dropdown and should cover an extra category that is currently not in the bookstore for boundary test use. Meanwhile, end users should always have the option to return to the default status (display all books no matter which category they belong to).(see Figure 3 as an example)

‚Ä¢ The functions of the search and filter should be able to work together and combine the result of each other. (See Figure 4 as an example).

Figure 2. Highlight the searched row

Figure 4. Combined result of search and filter functions

‚Ä¢ End users should be able to select books and add them to the ‚ÄúShopping Cart‚Äù through the checkbox ahead of them with the button ‚ÄúAdd to cart‚Äù.

‚Ä¢ End users can clear the shopping cart through the ‚ÄúReset the Cart‚Äù button. Users

should be prompted with a message box to confirm their desired action (‚ÄúReset the cart‚Äù or ‚ÄúCancel‚Äù).

‚Ä¢ The ‚ÄúShopping Cart‚Äù should always show the correct number of books in the cart based on the end user actions (see Figure 5 as an example).

Design and Implementation Requirements

You should consider the behavior of boundary cases and design suitable UI changes to notify the end users (e.g. an alarm). Sample boundary cases include, but are not restricted to the followings:

‚Ä¢ Search term does not appear in any title

‚Ä¢ Users select the category that does not contain any books

Each function mentioned above should work on the output of other functions.

Make sure that your HTML, CSS rules and JavaScript code are kept in separate files. Inline style or JavaScript code is not accepted.

Make sure that your HTML and CSS files are ‚Äúclean‚Äù enough. They should not contain any unnecessary automatically generated content such as scattered &lt;span&gt; element with pieces of styles.

Use of jQuery or other JavaScript library is not allowed in this assignment. Use of Bootstrap or other CSS framework is not allowed either.

Mark Distribution

‚Äì 1 mark each for normal search function

‚Äì 1 mark for normal filter function

‚Äì 1.5 mark for combining the search and filter functions

‚Äì 1 mark for boundary cases

Deliverable and Submission Guideline

‚Ä¢ Source code submission

5 demo. You can download the cover sheet from:

http://sydney.edu.au/engineering/it/current_students/undergrad/policies/assignm ent_sheet_individual.pdf

The zip file should include your First and Last name and unikey in the file name. For example, if your is John Smith and UniKey is abcd1234, you would label your zip file as John_Smith_abcd1234_Assignment1.zip
